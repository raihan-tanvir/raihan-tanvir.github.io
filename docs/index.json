If we can convert a handwritten piece of paper into a text-searchable document using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technique, we can easily understand the content and do not need to read a handwritten document. OCR in the English language is very common, but in the Bengali language, it is very hard to find a good quality OCR application. If we can merge machine learning and deep learning with OCR, it can be a huge contribution to this field. A variety of techniques have been suggested by various researchers on Bengali handwritten character recognition. A lot of machine learning algorithms and deep neural networks were used in their work, but the explanations of their models are not available. In our work, we have used different machine learning models and CNN also to recognize handwritten Bengali digits. We have got acceptable accuracy from some ML models, and CNN has given us great testing accuracy. Grad-CAM was used as an XAI method on our CNN model, which gave us insights about the model and helped us to detect the origin of interest for recognizing a digit from an image.","tags":["ML","CNN","XAI","OCR","Bengali OCR","Grad-CAM"],"title":"Bengali Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN with Explainable AI","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Raihan Tanvir","Md Tanvir Rouf Shawon","Md Humaion Kabir Mehedi","Md Motahar Mahtab","Annajiat Alim Rasel"],"categories":[],"content":"\r","date":1657802488,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1657802488,"objectID":"d765d0b2a7f5bab90e81e043f51cce2a","permalink":"https://raihan-tanvir.github.io/publication/gan-bangla-bert/","publishdate":"2022-07-14T18:41:28+06:00","relpermalink":"/publication/gan-bangla-bert/","section":"publication","summary":"Basic machine learning algorithms or transfer learning models work well for language categorization, but these models require a vast volume of annotated data. We need a better model to tackle the problem because labeled data is scarce. This problem may have a solution in GAN-BERT. To classify Bengali text, we developed a GAN-BERT based model, which is an adapted version of BERT. We used two different datasets for this purpose. One is a hate speech dataset, while the other is a fake news dataset. To understand how the GAN-Bert and basic BERT models behave with Bangla datasets, we experimented with both. With a small quantity of data, we were able to get a satisfactory result using GAN-BERT. We also demonstrated how the accuracy increases as the number of training samples increases. A comparison of performance between traditional BERT based Bangla-BERT and our GAN-Bangla-BERT model is also shown here, where we can see how these models react to a small number of labeled data.","tags":["NLP","BNLP","SS-GAN","BERT","GAN-BERT","Text Classification","Fake News Detection","Hate Speech Detection"],"title":"A GAN-BERT Based Approach for Bengali Text Classification with a Few Labeled Examples","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1655683200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1655683200,"objectID":"06eeea20188ca8e8217682c48c86a42d","permalink":"https://raihan-tanvir.github.io/post/iccit-2020/","publishdate":"2022-06-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/iccit-2020/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Presented a Paper in 2022 19th International Conference on Distributed Computing and Artificial Intelligence, L’Aquila, Italy","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Overview We are thrilled to announce that our team has made it to the top 50 at Unibator, the most extensive venture incubation competition launched by the Ministry of ICT, Bangladesh Hi-Tech Park Authority (BHTPA), and the Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh (IEB).

Interesting aspects of this problem include its time reliance as well as its volatility and other such complex relationships. To combine them, hidden Markov models (HMMs) have been utilized to anticipate and predict the stock market. We demonstrated the Maximum a Posteriori HMM method for predicting stock prices for the next day based on previous data. HMM is trained by analyzing the fractional change in the stock price as well as the intraday high and low values. It is then used to create a Maximum a Posteriori decision across all possible stock prices for the next day using the HMM model. The approach demonstrated in our work is quite generalized and can be used to predict the stock prices for any company, given that the hmm is trained on the dataset of that company's stocks dataset. We evaluated the accuracy of our models using some extensively used accuracy metrics for regression problems and came up with a satisfactory outcome.","tags":["HMM","Time Series Analysis","Dhaka Stock Exchange","Stock Price Forecasting"],"title":"DSE Stock Price Prediction using Hidden Markov Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1608422400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608422400,"objectID":"587a4a6595267e7530c3956ff1ea09b7","permalink":"https://raihan-tanvir.github.io/post/dcai-2022/","publishdate":"2020-12-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/dcai-2022/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Participated in 2020 23rd International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (ICCIT), Dhaka, Bangladesh","type":"post"},{"authors":["MD Tanvir Rouf Shawon","Raihan Tanvir","Humaira Ferdous Shifa","Susmoy Kar","Mohammad Imrul Jubair"],"categories":["Deep Learning","Artificial Intelligence"],"content":"\r","date":1607257637,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607257637,"objectID":"eaaf6ccfa11e47680d961e85bec64ca3","permalink":"https://raihan-tanvir.github.io/publication/generative-jamdani/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/generative-jamdani/","section":"publication","summary":"Jamdani is the strikingly patterned textile heritage of Bangladesh. The exclusive geometric motifs woven on the fabric are the most attractive part of this craftsmanship having a remarkable influence on textile and fine art. In this paper, we have developed a technique based on Generative  Adversarial Network that can learn to generate entirely new Jamdani patterns from a collection of Jamdani motifs that we assembled; the newly formed motifs can mimic the appearance of the original designs. Users can input the skeleton of the desired pattern in terms of rough strokes and our system finalizes the input by generating the complete motif which follows the geometric structure of real Jamdani ones. To serve this purpose, we collected and preprocessed a dataset containing a large number of Jamdani motifs images from authentic sources via fieldwork and applied a state-of-the-art method called pix2pix on it. To the best of our knowledge, this dataset is currently the only available dataset of Jamdani motifs in digital format for computer vision research. Our experimental results of the pix2pix model on this dataset show satisfactory outputs of computer-generated images of Jamdani motifs and we believe that our  work will open a new avenue for further research.","tags":["Deep Learning","GAN","Pix2Pix"],"title":"Jamdani Motif Generation using Conditional GAN","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1606953600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606953600,"objectID":"5240e7ac261e0f4d83457037e91c3543","permalink":"https://raihan-tanvir.github.io/post/iccit-2020-acceptance/","publishdate":"2020-12-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/iccit-2020-acceptance/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Successfully defended my Undergraduate Thesis","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1605830400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605830400,"objectID":"7ce829b240ac5b310c72b8f02c630813","permalink":"https://raihan-tanvir.github.io/post/bsc-thesis/","publishdate":"2020-11-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/bsc-thesis/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"One paper got accepted at ICCIT 2020","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Deep Learning"],"content":"We propose a solution which uses state-of-the-art techniques in Deep Learning to tackle the problem of Bengali Handwritten Character Recognition (HCR).
